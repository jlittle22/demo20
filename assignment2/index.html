        Thank you so very much for the beautiful casket cover you did for my mom, Evelyn Thompson. 
        It was splendid! She loved flowers and would feel so honored! 
        You all did an amazing job on my daughter's wedding flowers. I appreciate all you have done for our family over the years. You also often delivered flowers for special days to my mom. 
        You are a blessing!

        As always, John's Flowerie delivered a beautiful bouquet that my husband ordered for Mothers' Day. I am so impressed that the flowers were fresh and didn't bloom fully for about a day, when the filled the house with fragrance. They're beautiful and the aroma throughout the house is heavenly. You ALWAYS do an amazing job; thank you so much. The delivery was above and beyond: I was not at home when the delivery was made, but when I arrived home I found a notice in the mailbox regarding the delivery, as well as a voice message on my phone, notifying me of the time and location of the bouquet. Super service!! Thank you all so much for the service you provide to the Smyrna community. I formerly worked at Emory-Adventist Hospital and saw flowers from your shop almost daily. They were spectacular. Best wishes,
        <br/>
